## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```
To download wolmo-core-iOS, add this to your Cartfile:
```
github "Wolox/wolmo-core-ios" "swift-2.3"
```

### Manually
[Bootstrap](#bootstrap) the project and then drag it to your workspace.

## Usage

The framework is divided into 2 sections: [Utilities](#utilities) and [Extensions](#extensions). 

The main difference between them is that `utilities` represent components that are independent of the existance of another component. On the other hand, `extensions` represent extra functionality for other existent components. Extensions exist only because the components they rely on exists.

### Utilities
Constitutes a component which is independent from another component.

For example, [AlertViewPresenter](Core/Utilities/Alerts/AlertViewPresenter.swift) represents the behaviour of presenting an alert. In this case, any class (struct, enum, etc...) which can adopt this behaviour may be an `AlertViewPresenter`. 

In this framework, we give a default implementation of `UIViewController` as an `AlertViewPresenter`. However, note that they are independent one from another.

`Wolmo-core` provides the following utilities:

1. [AlertViewPresenter](Core/Utilities/Alerts/AlertViewPresenter.swift): Abstracts the logic of presenting different type of alerts.
2. [ProgressHUDDelegate](Core/Utilities/ProgressHUD/ProgressHUDDelegate.swift): Abstracts the logic of presenting a progress HUD, usually used in blocking operation (like a sign up).
3. [ActionHandler](Core/Utilities/ActionHandler.swift): Closure-based handlers for UIControlEvents (great for UIButtons).
4. [AssociatedObject](Core/Utilities/AssociatedObject.swift): Setter and getted for associated objects. Works with objects and value types.
5. [DeviceType](Core/Utilities/DeviceType.swift): Provides the current device type.
6. [CellIdentifiable](Core/Utilities/CellIdentifiable.swift): Identifies a cell. Usually used with `UICollectionView` and `UITableView`.

### Extensions
Extends the behaviour of a component (`class`, `struct`, `enum`, ...) by adding common functionality (functions, computed properties, initializers, ...). 

Extensions contain components which depends exclusively on other components. 

For example, [Collapsable](Core/Extensions/UIKit/UIView/Collapsable.swift) represents a collapsable element. This behaviour is an addition to a `UIView`; it would not make sense to have something which is not renderable as `Collapsable`. Furthermore, it doesn't make sense for `Collapsable` to exist per se; it is a behaviour added to any view which conforms to it.

`Wolmo-core` provides the following extensions:

1. [ReactiveCocoa](Core/Extensions/ReactiveCocoa): Extensions for [Signal](Core/Extensions/ReactiveCocoa/Signal.swift) and [SignalProducer](Core/Extensions/ReactiveCocoa/SignalProducer.swift).
2. [AVFoundation](Core/Extensions/AVFoundation): Extensions used for AVFoundation elements, such as [AVAsset](Core/Extensions/AVFoundation/AVAsset.swift) and [AVPlayerItem](Core/Extensions/AVFoundation/AVPlayerItem.swift).
3. [UIKit](Core/Extensions/UIKit): Extensions for UIKit elements, such as [UIView](Core/Extensions/UIKit/UIView/UIView.swift) and [UIViewController](Core/Extensions/UIKit/UIViewController.swift).
4. [Foundation](Core/Extensions/Foundation): Extensions for Foundation elements, such as [String](Core/Extensions/Foundation/String.swift), [Array](Core/Extensions/Foundation/Array.swift) and [NSDate](Core/Extensions/Foundation/NSDate.swift).

## Bootstrap
```
git clone git@github.com:Wolox/wolmo-core-ios.git
cd wolmo-core-ios
script/bootstrap
```

## Contributing
1. Fork it
2. [Bootstrap](#bootstrap) using the forked repository (instead of `Wolox/wolmo-core-ios.git`, `your-user/wolmo-core-ios.git`)
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Run tests (`./script/test`)
6. Push your branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create a new Pull Request
